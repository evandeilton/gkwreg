\arguments{
\item{x}{A fitted model object of class \code{"gkwreg"}.}

\item{which}{Integer vector specifying which diagnostic plots to produce.
Valid values are from 1 to 6, corresponding to:
\enumerate{
\item Residuals vs. Observation Indices.
\item Cook's Distance Plot.
\item Generalized Leverage vs. Fitted Values.
\item Residuals vs. Linear Predictor.
\item Half-Normal Plot of Residuals.
\item Predicted vs. Observed Values.
}}

\item{caption}{A character vector of captions for the plots. Its length must be at
least \code{max(which)}.}

\item{sub.caption}{A character string for a common subtitle above the plots (e.g.,
the original call of the model). Defaults to the deparsed call of \code{x}.}

\item{main}{An optional character string to be used as the main title for each plot,
appended to the respective caption.}

\item{ask}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the user is prompted before each plot (only applicable
to base R graphics). Defaults to \code{TRUE} when the number of plots exceeds the current
graphics layout.}

\item{...}{Additional graphical parameters to be passed to the underlying plotting functions.}

\item{type}{Character string indicating the type of residual to be used.
Valid options are:
\itemize{
\item \code{"quantile"}: Quantile residuals, based on the probability integral transform.
Recommended for bounded response variables like those in GKw regression.
\item \code{"pearson"}: Pearson residuals, standardized by the estimated standard deviation.
Useful for identifying heteroscedasticity.
\item \code{"deviance"}: Deviance residuals, based on the contribution to the deviance.
Helpful for assessing model fit quality.
}
Defaults to \code{"quantile"}.}

\item{family}{Character string specifying the distribution family to use.
If NULL (default), uses the family from the fitted model.
Available options: "gkw", "bkw", "kkw", "ekw", "mc", "kw", "beta".}

\item{nsim}{Integer; number of simulations for the half-normal plot envelope.
Must be a positive integer. Defaults to 100.}

\item{level}{Numeric; confidence level for the half-normal plot envelope.
Must be between 0 and 1. Defaults to 0.90.}

\item{use_ggplot}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, ggplot2 is used for plotting, otherwise base R
graphics are used. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{arrange_plots}{Logical; if \code{TRUE} and \code{use_ggplot = TRUE}, attempts to
arrange multiple plots in a grid using \code{gridExtra::grid.arrange} or
\code{ggpubr::ggarrange}. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{sample_size}{Integer or NULL; if provided and less than the number of observations,
a random sample of observations of this size will be used for plotting. Useful for very
large datasets. Defaults to NULL (use all observations).}

\item{theme_fn}{Function; a ggplot2 theme function to be applied to all plots when
\code{use_ggplot = TRUE}. Defaults to \code{ggplot2::theme_minimal()}.}

\item{save_diagnostics}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, returns a list with the diagnostic
measures used for plotting. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns either the fitted model object \code{x} (if \code{save_diagnostics = FALSE})
or a list containing the diagnostic measures (if \code{save_diagnostics = TRUE}).
}
\description{
This S3 method produces a set of diagnostic plots for a fitted Generalized
Kumaraswamy (GKw) regression model, as returned by \code{\link{gkwreg}}.
The function provides standard plots for residual analysis, influence measures,
and goodness-of-fit assessment. Users may choose between base R graphics or
ggplot2 for plotting.
