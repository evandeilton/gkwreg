\title{Extract Fitted Values from a Generalized Kumaraswamy Regression Model}
\usage{
fitted.gkwreg(object, family = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"gkwreg"}, typically the result of a
call to \code{\link{gkwreg}}.}

\item{family}{Character string specifying the distribution family under which
the fitted mean values should be calculated. If \code{NULL} (default), the
family stored within the fitted \code{object} is used. Specifying a different
family (e.g., \code{"beta"}) will trigger recalculation of the fitted means
based on that family's mean structure, using the original model's estimated
coefficients mapped to the relevant parameters. Available options match those
in \code{\link{gkwreg}}: \code{"gkw", "bkw", "kkw", "ekw", "mc", "kw", "beta"}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments, currently ignored by this method.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector containing the fitted mean values. These values are
typically bounded between 0 and 1, corresponding to the scale of the original
response variable. The length of the vector corresponds to the number of
observations used in the model fit (considering \code{subset} and \code{na.action}).
}
\description{
Extracts the fitted mean values (predicted expected values of the response)
from a fitted Generalized Kumaraswamy (GKw) regression model object of class
\code{"gkwreg"}. This is an S3 method for the generic
\code{\link[stats]{fitted.values}} function.
}
\details{
This function retrieves or calculates the fitted values, which represent the
estimated conditional mean of the response variable given the covariates
(\eqn{E(Y | X)}).

The function attempts to retrieve fitted values efficiently using the following
priority:
\enumerate{
\item Directly from the \code{fitted.values} component stored in the \code{object},
if available and complete. It includes logic to handle potentially
incomplete stored values via interpolation (\code{\link[stats]{approx}}) for
very large datasets where only a sample might be stored.
\item By recalculating the mean using stored parameter vectors for each
observation (\code{object$parameter_vectors}) and an internal function
(\code{calculateMeans}), if available.
\item From the \code{fitted} component within the TMB report (\code{object$tmb_object$report()}),
if available, potentially using interpolation as above.
\item As a fallback, by calling \code{predict(object, type = "response", family = family)}.
}
Specifying a \code{family} different from the one used to fit the model will
always force recalculation using the \code{predict} method (step 4).
