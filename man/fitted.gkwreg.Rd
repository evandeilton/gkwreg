\title{Extract Fitted Values from a Generalized Kumaraswamy Regression Model}
\usage{
\method{fitted}{gkwreg}(object, family = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object of class "gkwreg".}

\item{family}{Character string specifying the distribution family to use.
If NULL (default), uses the family from the fitted model.
Available options: "gkw", "bkw", "kkw", "ekw", "mc", "kw", "beta".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. Currently not used.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of fitted values (predicted means) on the scale of the
original response. For the GKw model, these are values between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Extract the fitted values (predicted means) from a fitted Generalized Kumaraswamy
regression model.
}
\details{
The fitted values are extracted directly from the model object if available.
If not available (which may happen in rare cases), they are recalculated using
the model parameters and the specified family. The values represent the predicted
means of the response variable conditional on the observed covariates.

When using a different family than what was used to fit the model (by specifying
the 'family' parameter), the function will always recalculate the fitted values
using the predict method instead of using stored values.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit a GKw model
model <- gkwreg(y ~ x1 | x2 | 1 | 1 | 1, data = mydata, family = "gkw")

# Extract fitted values
fitted_values <- fitted(model)

# Extract fitted values using a different family
fitted_values_beta <- fitted(model, family = "beta")

# Plot observed vs. fitted
plot(model$y, fitted_values,
  xlab = "Observed", ylab = "Fitted",
  main = "Observed vs Fitted Values"
)
abline(0, 1, col = "red", lty = 2)
