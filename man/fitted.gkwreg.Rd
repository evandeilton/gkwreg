\title{Extract Fitted Values from a Generalized Kumaraswamy Regression Model}
\usage{
\method{fitted}{gkwreg}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object of class "gkwreg".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. Currently not used.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of fitted values (predicted means) on the scale of the
original response. For the GKw model, these are values between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Extract the fitted values (predicted means) from a fitted Generalized Kumaraswamy
regression model.
}
\details{
The fitted values are extracted directly from the model object if available.
If not available (which may happen in rare cases), they are recalculated using
the model parameters. The values represent the predicted means of the response
variable conditional on the observed covariates.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Fit a GKw model
model <- gkwreg(y ~ x1 | x2 | 1 | 1 | 1, data = mydata)

# Extract fitted values
fitted_values <- fitted(model)

# Plot observed vs. fitted
plot(model$y, fitted_values,
  xlab = "Observed", ylab = "Fitted",
  main = "Observed vs Fitted Values"
)
abline(0, 1, col = "red", lty = 2)
