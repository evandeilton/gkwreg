\title{Extract Log-Likelihood from a Generalized Kumaraswamy Regression Model}
\usage{
\method{logLik}{gkwreg}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"gkwreg"}, typically the result of a call
to \code{\link{gkwreg}}.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently not used).}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{"logLik"} with the following attributes:
\itemize{
\item \code{df}: The number of estimated parameters in the model.
\item \code{nobs}: The number of observations used for fitting the model.
}
}
\description{
This function extracts the log-likelihood value from a fitted Generalized
Kumaraswamy regression model. The result is returned as an object of class
\code{"logLik"}, which can be used for model selection and comparison.
}
\details{
The log-likelihood for Generalized Kumaraswamy regression models is computed
during model fitting and stored in the model object. This function retrieves
the stored value and creates a proper \code{"logLik"} object with the appropriate
attributes for use with model selection criteria and likelihood ratio tests.

For GKw family models, the log-likelihood is computed as:

\deqn{l(\theta) = \sum_{i=1}^n \log f(y_i; \alpha_i, \beta_i, \gamma_i, \delta_i, \lambda_i)}

where \eqn{f(y; \alpha, \beta, \gamma, \delta, \lambda)} is the probability
density function of the specific distribution from the GKw family, and \eqn{\theta}
represents all model parameters.

\dontrun{
# Fit a Kumaraswamy regression model
kw_reg <- gkwreg(y ~ x1 + x2 | x3, data = df, family = "kw")

# Extract log-likelihood
ll <- logLik(kw_reg)
print(ll)

# Get the number of parameters
attr(ll, "df")
