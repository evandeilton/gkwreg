\title{Compare Goodness-of-Fit Results Across Multiple Models}
\usage{
plotcompare(gof_list, criteria = "all", plot = TRUE, plot_type = "all", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{gof_list}{A named list of gkwgof objects, where names are used as model identifiers.}

\item{criteria}{Character vector specifying which criteria to compare. Available options are:
"information" (for AIC, BIC, etc.), "distance" (for KS, CvM, AD, etc.),
"prediction" (for MAE, RMSE, etc.), "probability" (for P-P, Q-Q correlations),
or "all" for all criteria. Default is "all".}

\item{plot}{Logical; if TRUE, creates comparison plots. Default is TRUE.}

\item{plot_type}{Character string specifying the type of plot to create. Available options are:
"radar" for a radar chart (requires the fmsb package),
"bar" for bar charts, "table" for a formatted table,
or "all" for all plot types. Default is "all".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to be passed to plotting functions.}
}
\value{
A list containing the comparison results and plots.
}
\description{
Creates a comparison of goodness-of-fit statistics and plots across multiple models
from the GKw family of distributions.

# Generate sample data
