\usage{
\method{BIC}{gkwreg}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"gkwreg"}, typically the result of a call
to \code{\link{gkwreg}}.}

\item{...}{Optionally, additional objects of class \code{"gkwreg"} for model
comparison.}
}
\value{
If just one object is provided, returns a numeric BIC value. If multiple
objects are provided, returns a data frame with rows corresponding to the objects
and columns representing the number of parameters (df) and BIC values.
}
\description{
Calculates the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), also known as Schwarz's
Bayesian Criterion (SBC), for one or more fitted Generalized Kumaraswamy
regression models. BIC is a criterion for model selection that penalizes model
complexity more strongly than AIC.
}
\details{
The BIC is calculated as:

\deqn{BIC = -2 \times \log(L) + k \times \log(n)}

where \eqn{L} is the maximized likelihood function, \eqn{k} is the number of
estimated parameters in the model, and \eqn{n} is the number of observations.
The model with the lowest BIC is generally preferred.

BIC penalizes model complexity more strongly than AIC, especially for larger
sample sizes. It is derived from a Bayesian framework and approximates the
Bayes factor for large sample sizes.

\dontrun{
# Fit two competing models
kw_reg1 <- gkwreg(y ~ x1 | x2, data = df, family = "kw")
kw_reg2 <- gkwreg(y ~ x1 + x3 | x2, data = df, family = "kw")

# Compare models using BIC
BIC(kw_reg1, kw_reg2)
