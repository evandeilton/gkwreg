\usage{
\method{residuals}{gkwreg}(
  object,
  type = c("response", "pearson", "deviance", "quantile", "modified.deviance",
    "cox-snell", "score", "partial"),
  covariate_idx = 1,
  parameter = "alpha",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object of class "gkwreg".}

\item{type}{The type of residuals to be computed. Options include:
\itemize{
\item "response" (default): Response residuals (y - fitted)
\item "pearson": Pearson residuals (standardized by estimated std dev)
\item "deviance": Deviance residuals (signed sqrt of deviance contributions)
\item "quantile": Quantile residuals (normal quantiles of CDF at response)
\item "modified.deviance": Modified deviance residuals (standardized deviance)
\item "cox-snell": Cox-Snell residuals (transformation of CDF)
\item "score": Score residuals (based on score function)
\item "partial": Partial residuals (requires covariate index)
}}

\item{covariate_idx}{Integer. For 'partial' residuals, specifies which covariate to use
(1 for first covariate, 2 for second, etc.). Only used if type="partial".}

\item{parameter}{Parameter name for partial residuals. One of "alpha", "beta", "gamma",
"delta", or "lambda". Only used if type="partial".}

\item{...}{Additional arguments. Currently not used.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of residuals.

\description{
Extract various types of residuals from a fitted Generalized Kumaraswamy regression model
for diagnostic purposes.
}
\details{
The different types of residuals offer various diagnostic tools for the GKw regression model:

\itemize{
\item Response residuals: The raw difference between observed and fitted values.

\item Pearson residuals: Response residuals standardized by the estimated standard
deviation from the GKw model. Useful for checking heteroscedasticity.

\item Deviance residuals: Signed square root of deviance contributions.
Useful for assessing model fit.

\item Quantile residuals: Normal quantiles of the GKw CDF evaluated at observed values.
These should follow a standard normal distribution if the model is correct.

\item Modified deviance residuals: Standardized deviance residuals that should
better approximate a normal distribution.

\item Cox-Snell residuals: Based on -log(1-F(y)), should follow exponential(1)
distribution if the model is correct. Uses the GKw CDF.

\item Score residuals: Based on the score function from the GKw log-likelihood.
Useful for assessing influence.

\item Partial residuals: For examining individual covariate effects in the context
of the GKw model.
}

All calculations use the specific properties of the Generalized Kumaraswamy distribution
and are performed efficiently in C++ to ensure good performance even with large datasets.
