\title{Compare Fitted gkwfit Models using Likelihood Ratio Tests}
\usage{
\method{anova}{gkwfit}(object, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{"gkwfit"}, representing the first fitted model.}

\item{...}{One or more additional objects of class \code{"gkwfit"}, representing
subsequent fitted models, assumed to be nested within each other or the first model.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{c("anova.gkwfit", "anova", "data.frame")}.
This data frame contains rows for each model and columns summarizing the fit
and the pairwise likelihood ratio tests. It includes:
\item{N.Par}{Number of estimated parameters (degrees of freedom).}
\item{AIC}{Akaike Information Criterion.}
\item{BIC}{Bayesian Information Criterion.}
\item{LogLik}{Log-likelihood value.}
\item{Test}{Description of the pairwise comparison (e.g., "1 vs 2").}
\item{LR stat.}{Likelihood Ratio test statistic.}
\item{Pr(>Chi)}{P-value from the Chi-squared test.}
The table is printed using a method that mimics \code{print.anova}.
}
\description{
Computes Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT) to compare two or more nested models
fitted using \code{\link{gkwfit}}. It produces a table summarizing the models
and the test statistics.
}
\details{
This function performs pairwise likelihood ratio tests between consecutively ordered
models (ordered by their degrees of freedom). It assumes the models are nested
and are fitted to the same dataset. A warning is issued if the number of
observations differs between models.

The Likelihood Ratio statistic is calculated as \eqn{LR = 2 \times (\log L_{complex} - \log L_{simple})}.
This statistic is compared to a Chi-squared distribution with degrees of freedom
equal to the difference in the number of parameters between the two models
(\eqn{\Delta df = df_{complex} - df_{simple}}).

The output table includes the number of parameters (\code{N.Par}), AIC, BIC, log-likelihood (\code{LogLik}),
the test description (\code{Test}), the LR statistic (\verb{LR stat.}), and the p-value (\verb{Pr(>Chi)}).
Models are ordered by increasing complexity (number of parameters).

Warnings are issued if models do not appear correctly nested based on degrees of
freedom or if the log-likelihood decreases for a more complex model, as the LRT
results may not be meaningful in such cases.

The function relies on a working \code{\link{logLik.gkwfit}} method to extract
necessary information (log-likelihood, df, nobs).

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Assume necessary functions (rkw, rbkw, gkwfit, logLik.gkwfit) exist

set.seed(123)
sample_data <- rkw(150, alpha = 2.5, beta = 1.5) # Data from Kw

# Fit nested models (e.g., Kw is nested within BKw, which is nested within GKw)
fit_kw <- gkwfit(sample_data, family = "kw", silent = TRUE) # 2 params
fit_bkw <- gkwfit(sample_data, family = "bkw", silent = TRUE) # 4 params
fit_gkw <- gkwfit(sample_data, family = "gkw", silent = TRUE) # 5 params

# Compare the nested models using LRT
lrt_results <- anova(fit_kw, fit_bkw, fit_gkw)
print(lrt_results)

# Example comparing only two models
anova(fit_kw, fit_gkw)
