#'
#' @details
#' This dataset was collected by Prater (1956) to study gasoline yield from crude
#' oil. The dependent variable is the proportion of crude oil after distillation
#' and fractionation. Atkinson (1985) analyzed this dataset using linear
#' regression and noted that there is "indication that the error distribution is
#' not quite symmetrical, giving rise to some unduly large and small residuals".
#'
#' The dataset contains 32 observations. It has been noted (Daniel and Wood, 1971,
#' Chapter 8) that there are only ten sets of values of the first three
#' explanatory variables which correspond to ten different crudes subjected to
#' experimentally controlled distillation conditions. These conditions are captured
#' in variable `batch` and the data were ordered according to the ascending order
#' of `temp10`.

#' (No) Myopic Loss Aversion in Adolescents
#'
#' Data from a behavioral economics experiment assessing the extent of myopic loss
#' aversion among adolescents aged 11 to 19 years. The experiment tests whether
#' short-term investment horizons lead to more conservative investment behavior.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 570 observations on 7 variables:

#'     rounds of the experiment (response variable).}

#' }
#'
#' @details
#' The data were collected by Matthias Sutter and Daniela Glätzle-Rützler
#' (Universität Innsbruck) in an experiment with high-school students in Tyrol,
#' Austria (Schwaz and Innsbruck). The experiment tests the theory of myopic loss
#' aversion, which proposes that investors with shorter evaluation periods are more
#' loss-averse and thus invest less in risky assets.
#'
#' Classical theory predicts that players with short investment horizons (myopic
#' view) should invest less due to loss aversion. However, Sutter et al. (2015)
#' found no evidence of myopic loss aversion in adolescents, contrary to findings
#' in adult populations.
#'
#' The investment game structure: In each round, players could invest tokens in a
#' risky asset with 50% chance of doubling or losing the investment. The treatment
#' varied the feedback frequency (short = every round, medium = every 3 rounds,
#' long = only at the end).

#' Dyslexia and IQ Predicting Reading Accuracy
#'
#' Data for assessing the contribution of non-verbal IQ to children's reading
#' skills in dyslexic and non-dyslexic children. This is a classic dataset
#' demonstrating beta regression with interaction effects and heteroscedasticity.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 44 observations on 4 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{accuracy}{numeric. Reading accuracy score scaled to the open unit
#'     interval (0, 1). Perfect scores of 1 were replaced with 0.99.}

#'   \item{iq}{numeric. Non-verbal intelligence quotient transformed to z-scores
#'     (mean = 0, SD = 1).}
#' }
#'
#' @details
#' The data were collected by Pammer and Kevan (2004) and employed by Smithson and
#' Verkuilen (2006) in their seminal beta regression paper. The sample includes 19
#' dyslexic children and 25 controls recruited from primary schools in the
#' Australian Capital Territory. Children's ages ranged from 8 years 5 months to
#' 12 years 3 months.
#'
#' Mean reading accuracy was 0.606 for dyslexic readers and 0.900 for controls.
#' The study investigates whether dyslexia contributes to reading accuracy even
#' when controlling for IQ (which is on average lower for dyslexics).
#'
#' **Transformation details:** The original reading accuracy score was transformed
#' by Smithson and Verkuilen (2006) to fit beta regression requirements:
#' 1. First, the original accuracy was scaled using the minimal and maximal scores
#' (a and b) that can be obtained in the test: `accuracy1 = (original - a)/(b - a)`
#' (a and b values are not provided).
#' 2. Subsequently, `accuracy` was obtained from `accuracy1` by replacing all
#' observations with a value of 1 with 0.99 to fit the open interval (0, 1).
#'
#' The data clearly show asymmetry and heteroscedasticity (especially in the control
#' group), making beta regression more appropriate than standard linear regression.

#' Weather Task with Priming and Precise and Imprecise Probabilities
#'
#' Data from a cognitive psychology experiment on probabilistic learning and

#' }
#'
#' @details
#' All participants in the study were either first- or second-year undergraduate
#' students in psychology, none of whom had a strong background in probability or
#' were familiar with imprecise probability theories.
#'
#' **Task description:** Participants were asked: "What is the probability that the
#' temperature at Canberra airport on Sunday will be higher than 'specified
#' temperature'?"
#'
#' **Experimental manipulations:**
#' - **Priming:** Two-fold (simple binary: above/below) vs. seven-fold (multiple
#'   temperature categories)
#' - **Eliciting:** Precise (single probability estimate) vs. imprecise (lower and
#'   upper bounds)
#'
#' The study examines how partition priming (number of response categories) and
#' elicitation format affect probability judgments. Classical findings suggest that
#' more categories (seven-fold) lead to different probability assessments than
#' binary categories (two-fold).

#'
#' The key manipulation is the implicit partition: In the Car condition, there are

#'
#' @details
#' This dataset contains clinical data from autologous peripheral blood stem cell
#' (PBSC) transplant patients treated at the Cross Cancer Institute, Alberta Health
#' Services. CD34+ cells are hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells critical for
#' successful transplantation and hematopoietic recovery.
#'
#' **Clinical context:** Autologous PBSC transplantation is used to treat various
#' hematological malignancies including multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma,
#' acute leukemia, and some solid tumors. The recovery rate of CD34+ cells is a
#' crucial predictor of engraftment success and patient outcomes.
#'
#' **Chemotherapy protocols:**
#' - **1-day protocol:** Single-day high-dose chemotherapy for mobilization
#' - **3-day protocol:** Multi-day chemotherapy regimen
#' - **G-CSF only:** Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor without chemotherapy
#' - **Other:** Alternative or combined protocols
#'
#' The proportion of recovered CD34+ cells naturally falls in the interval (0, 1),
#' making it ideal for proportional data regression modeling. Age effects are
#' particularly important as older patients may show different recovery patterns.
#'
#' This dataset is particularly suitable for:

#' }
#'
#' @details
#' This longitudinal dataset comes from a study of gas decay following vitreoretinal
#' surgery. Perfluoropropane (C3F8) is commonly used as a temporary tamponade agent
#' in retinal detachment repair and other complex vitreoretinal procedures.
#'
#' **Clinical background:** During vitrectomy for retinal detachment, gas bubbles
#' are injected into the vitreous cavity to help reattach the retina by providing
#' internal tamponade. The gas gradually absorbs and dissipates over time. Understanding
#' the decay rate is important for:
#' - Predicting when patients can resume normal activities (esp. air travel)
#' - Assessing treatment efficacy
#' - Planning follow-up examinations
#'
#' **Decay kinetics:** Gas decay typically follows a nonlinear pattern that can be
#' approximated by exponential or power-law functions. The log transformation
#' (LogT, LogT2) helps linearize these relationships for regression modeling.
#'
#' **Data structure:** This is a longitudinal/panel dataset with repeated measurements
#' on the same patients over time. Correlation structures (exchangeable, AR(1), etc.)

#' The proportional nature of the gas variable (bounded between 0 and 1) makes this
#' dataset ideal for:
#' - Simplex marginal models (original application by Song & Tan 2000)
#' - Beta regression with longitudinal correlation structures
#' - Kumaraswamy regression with heteroscedastic errors

#' # Example 1: Nonlinear time decay with level effects
#' # Model gas decay as quadratic function of log-time

#'
#' # Interpretation:
#' # - Alpha: Decay curve shape varies by initial gas concentration
#' #   LogT + LogT2 capture nonlinear exponential-like decay
#' # - Beta: Precision differs by concentration level
#' #   Higher concentration may produce more/less variable decay
#'
#' # Example 2: Heteroscedastic model
#' # Variability in gas proportion may change over time
#' fit_kw_hetero <- gkwreg(

#' # Interpretation:
#' # - Lambda varies by level: Different initial concentrations may have
